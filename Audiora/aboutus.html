           <h2>About Us</h2>
           <p>Illuminate’s mission is to create the best possible service for artists and labels to share and earn money from their music, and for fans to discover and enjoy it.
            We believe that music is an indispensable part of culture, and for that culture to thrive, artists—no matter the size of their audience—must be compensated fairly
            and transparently for their work.Without this belief, our mission would be meaningless, and it’s why we’ve built our business around a model that can be enjoyable.<br><br>
            <p>Here we offer everyone a wide range of genre and muisc to decide from and enjoy accordingly , be it soft chill music or a rock that can knock your ears off.
            So we strive to make this a favorable platform for all age groups and its designed this way that one is able to listen the selected songs on spotify.<br><br>
            <p>Your Audiora profile is like your musical calling card. When someone asks “What music are you into?”, your profile has all the answers; your all time top 10,
            your favourite new release, or that track you’ve had on repeat all week. It’s everything you really listen to.<br><br>
            <p>Because you’ve got a record of everything you listen to, you can discover things you never knew about your listening habits. For example, find out when you 
            first listened to your favourite band, or what time of day you listen most. We help you uncover the secrets of your listening history.<br><br>
            <p>Sometimes it’s difficult to find new music. What you need is an expert who knows your taste inside out to do the hard work for you. We make discovery easy by
            recommending things you’ll like, based on your taste and the taste of other listeners just like you.<br><br>
