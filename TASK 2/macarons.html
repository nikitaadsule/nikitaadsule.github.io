          <h2><br>Macarons</h2>  
          <p>A macaron or French macaroon is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing 
            sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food colouring.</p>
          <p>The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen 
            Catherine de Medici during the Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style 
            macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies, 
            akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled 
            circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and 
            easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavours that range from traditional 
            (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha).</p>
