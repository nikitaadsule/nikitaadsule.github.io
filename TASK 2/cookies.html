          <h2><br>Cookies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains 
            flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as 
            raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.</p> 
          <p>In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called 
            biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in 
            the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.</p>  
          <p>Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, 
            Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another 
            sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes 
            "dunked", an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while 
            also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores 
            and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter 
            ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.</p>
