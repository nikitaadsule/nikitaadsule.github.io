          <h2><br>Churros</h2>
          <p>A churro is a type of fried dough from Spanish and Portuguese cuisine. They are also found in the 
            cuisine of the Philippines and Latin American cuisine and in other areas that have received 
            immigration from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries, especially in the Southwestern United 
            States and France.</p>
          <p>In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are 
            known as porras [es] or jeringos in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in 
            champurrado, hot chocolate, dulce de leche or café con leche. Cinnamon sugar is often sprinkled 
            on top.</p>
          <p>Like pretzels, churros are sold by street vendors, who may fry them freshly on the street stand 
            and sell them hot. In Spain and much of Latin America, churros are available in cafes for breakfast, 
            although they may be eaten throughout the day as a snack. Specialized churrerías, in the form of a shop or 
            a trailer, can be found during the holiday period. In addition, countries like Colombia, Peru, Spain, 
            and Venezuela have churrerías throughout their streets. In Portugal, they are commonly eaten at 
            carnivals, fairs and other celebrations, where they are made freshly at street stands.</p>
