          <h2><br>Birthday Cake</h2>
          <p>A birthday cake is a cake eaten as part of a birthday celebration. Birthday cakes are often 
              layer cakes with frosting served with small lit candles on top representing the celebrant's age. 
              Variations include cupcakes, cake pops, pastries, and tarts. The cake is often decorated with
               birthday wishes ("Happy birthday") and the celebrant's name.</p> 
          <p>There are many variations of sweets which are eaten around the world on birthdays. The Chinese 
              birthday pastry is the shòu bāo (壽包, simp. 寿包) or shòu táo bāo (壽桃包, simp. 寿桃包), a 
              lotus-paste-filled bun made of wheat flour and shaped and colored to resemble a peach. Rather 
              than serving one large pastry, each guest is served their own small shou bao. In Western Russia, 
              birthday children are served fruit pies with a birthday greeting carved into the crusts. The 
              Swedish birthday cake is made like a pound cake that is often topped with marzipan and decorated 
              with the national flag. Dutch birthday pastries are fruit tarts topped with whipped cream. In 
              India there are very few people who celebrate birthdays in the villages, but in cities and towns, 
              birthday cakes are consumed similarly as in western countries, especially among people with higher 
              education.</p>
