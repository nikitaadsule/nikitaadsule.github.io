          <h2><br>Pancakes</h2>
          <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, not to be confused with oat bar flapjacks) is a 
            flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk 
            and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or 
            butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most 
            widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>
          <p>The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often 
            unleavened and resemble a crêpe. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking 
            powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked 
            on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. 
            A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a palačinke, a thin moist pancake fried on 
            both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet 
            or savoury—can also be used.</p>
