          <h2><br>Donut</h2>
          <p>A doughnut or donut is a type of leavened fried dough. It is popular in 
              many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or 
              purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. 'Doughnut' 
              is the traditional spelling, whilst 'donut' is the simplified version. Both terms are often used 
              interchangeably in the English-language.</p>
          <p>Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. 
              Various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple 
              glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and 
              natural or artificial flavors.</p>
          <p>The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with 
              fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small pieces of dough 
              are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing, 
              spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or 
              fruit. Other shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. </p>
