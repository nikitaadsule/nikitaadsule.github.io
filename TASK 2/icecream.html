          <h2><br>Ice Cream</h2>
          <p>Ice cream (derived from earlier cream ice) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a 
            snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either 
            sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries 
            or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. 
            Colorings are sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing 
            point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from 
            forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C 
            or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>
          <p>Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones. Ice cream 
            may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, 
            milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.</p>
